# Quasi Newton_Methode
This program uses Quasi Newton Method to optimise a function to its minimum. The user needs to download all three files to run the program and needs to enter his/her formula function in the matlab function file ‘f_2’. The user also needs to update his/her formula function at the 45th line of the file Quasi_newton_core_3dfigures. 
 	The program automatically displays a 3d figure which displays the progression of the algorithm on the surface of the function. The user can also follow the progression of the algorithm in the Command Window where ‘newcord’ shows the coordinates of the most recent point reached by the algorithm.  The user can also see the step ‘alpha’ taken along the direction vector define by the gradient times the hessian of the function.  The vector ‘image’ allows the user to observe the decrease in the objective dimension of the function at each loop of the algorithm.
